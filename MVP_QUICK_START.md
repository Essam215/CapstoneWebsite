## 📝 Registration

You can also register new accounts - they'll work for the current session. New users are created as students by default.

## 🔄 Switching to Real Backend

When you're ready to use the real PHP backend:

1. Set up the database (see `QUICK_START.md`)
2. Start PHP server (see `QUICK_START.md`)
3. Open `src/services/authService.ts`
4. Change `const MVP_MODE = true;` to `const MVP_MODE = false;`
5. Do the same in other service files

## 🎨 Features Available

- **Tasks:** Submit tasks with file uploads (mock mode)
- **Events:** Apply to events (mock mode)
- **Admin:** View statistics, manage tasks/events (mock data)
- **Notifications:** See notifications
- **Leaderboard:** View rankings
- **Badges:** View badges

Everything works, but uses mock data that doesn't persist between page refreshes (except user login which is stored in localStorage).

## 💡 Tips

- Login persists in localStorage
- Mock data resets on page refresh
- All UI features are fully functional
- Perfect for demos and testing!

Enjoy testing your MVP! 🚀
